# Firefly III Development Roadmap

This document tracks planned improvements and optimizations for Firefly III, organized by priority and implementation timeline.

## üöÄ High Priority (Next 1-2 months)

### Account Classification System Redesign ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Problem**: The existing account classification system had several architectural issues:
- Confusing naming conventions (e.g., `ccAsset` role for credit cards treated as assets)
- Redundant account types (Loan, Debt, Mortgage) that served identical purposes
- Missing generic "Liability" type despite having specific liability subtypes
- Duplication between `AccountTypeEnum` and database `account_types` table
- Inconsistent abstraction levels between assets (types + roles) and liabilities (types only)
- No support for complex account relationships (e.g., brokerage accounts containing securities)

**Solution Implemented**: Complete redesign with normalized, relationship-based architecture:

#### New Database Structure
- **`account_categories`**: 5 core categories (Asset, Liability, Expense, Revenue, Equity)
- **`account_behaviors`**: 4 behavior types (Simple, Container, Security, Cash)
- **`account_types`**: Specific account types with proper relationships to categories and behaviors
- **`relationship_types`**: Defines how accounts relate to each other
- **`security_positions`**: For tracking individual securities (stocks, bonds, etc.)
- **`position_allocations`**: Maps securities to container accounts (supports AAPL across multiple brokerages)
- **`account_relationships`**: Links accounts with metadata
- **`account_meta`**: Replaces the old account_meta table

#### Key Features
- **Zero Ambiguity**: Each account type has exactly one behavior pattern
- **Flexible Relationships**: Accounts can contain other accounts or hold securities
- **Position-Based**: Supports complex portfolio management (one AAPL account, multiple allocations)
- **Firefly Compatible**: Maintains `firefly_mapping` for integration
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new account types, behaviors, and relationships

#### Models Created
- `AccountCategory`, `AccountBehavior`, `RelationshipType`
- `SecurityPosition`, `PositionAllocation`, `AccountRelationship`
- `AccountMetadata` (replaces `AccountMeta`)
- Updated `AccountType` and `Account` models with new relationships

#### Migration Strategy
- Preserved all existing account types and data
- Mapped existing types to new normalized structure
- Updated all existing accounts to reference new account_type_ids
- Maintained foreign key relationships and data integrity

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Eliminated architectural inconsistencies
- Enabled complex account relationships (brokerage ‚Üí securities)
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Created foundation for advanced portfolio management features

### Account Field Validation System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Implement comprehensive field requirements for different account types
- [x] Add validation service for required vs optional fields
- [x] Integrate with AccountFactory and AccountUpdateService
- [x] Clean up legacy field arrays and configurations

### Product Name Display Enhancement ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Hide account "name" column from accounts/all page
- [x] Display "product_name" instead of generic account types
- [x] Add product_name to valid field configurations
- [x] Update IndexController to retrieve product_name from meta fields

## üîÑ Medium Priority (Next 3-6 months)

### Database Schema Optimization ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Problem**: Current `account_meta` table uses EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) pattern which causes:
- N+1 query problems when loading account metadata
- No indexing on specific metadata fields
- JSON parsing overhead for every access
- Poor query performance for filtering by metadata

**Solution Implemented**: Hybrid approach with structured tables + JSON flexibility:
- **`account_meta`**: Replaces `account_meta` with better indexing and type safety
- **`account_categories`**: Structured table for account categories
- **`account_behaviors`**: Structured table for account behaviors
- **`account_relationships`**: JSON metadata for flexible relationship data
- **`security_positions`**: Structured table for security-specific data

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Eliminated N+1 query problems
- Added proper indexing on frequently-queried fields
- Maintained flexibility with JSON for dynamic data
- Improved query performance for account operations
- Type safety for core account classification data

### Account Classification System Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create database tables for account classification hierarchy
- [x] Implement dynamic account type creation based on classification
- [x] Add comprehensive Eloquent models for new system
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- [ ] Add UI for managing account classifications
- [ ] Integrate with import processes
- [ ] Update existing Firefly III code to use new system
